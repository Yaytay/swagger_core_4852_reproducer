/**
 * Definition of an endpoint that can be used for querying data.
 * An Endpoint represents a connection to a data source, where a {@link Source} represents an actual data query.
 * For {@link EndpointType#HTTP} {@link Source}s there is often a one-to-one relationship between {@link Source} and Endpoint, but for {@link EndpointType#SQL} Sources there
 * are often multiple {@link Source}s for a single Endpoint.
 * 
 * The credentials for an Endpoint can be specified in three ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>By including them in the URL specified in the Endpoint definition.
 * This is the least secure option as the URL value will be written to log entries.
 * <li>By explicitly setting username/password on the Endpoint.
 * The password will not be logged, but will be in your configuration files and thus in your source repo.
 * <li>By using secrets set in the configuration of the query engine.
 * This is the most secure option as it puts the responsibility on the deployment to protect the credentials.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If the secret field is set it will take precedence over both the username and the password set in the Endpoint
 * , as a result it is not valid to set either username or password at the same time as secret.
 * The same does not apply to the condition field, that can be set on both the Endpoint and the Secret (and both conditions
 * must be met for the Endpoint to work).
